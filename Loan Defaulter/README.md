Introduction
This case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that we have learnt in the EDA module, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers



The aim of this project is to answer the following questions:

What would be your first step? List different EDA you would like to do with the data before you get started.
How are you going to handle missing values? Ideate and list them.
Before getting into modeling, apart from points a. and b., do you want to do anything else with the data to understand default behavior?
The default labeling is based on customers who did not pay 3 installments continuously. Do you want to rethink about this labelling strategy for the target? How will you validate the labelling strategy is correct?
How are you going to handle outliers, numerical columns and categorical columns
Do you want to include the entire 1000 features?




Recommendations-


Banks should target the customers-
 >> with lower income
 >> who prefer cash loans
 >> preferably females
 >> with higher education
 >> married people with house/apartment having children less than 5
 >> working, commercial associates and pensioners
 >> accountents, core staff, managers and labourers 

Banks should target--
 >> the loans with loan amt greater than 1.5ml
 >> the loans/products with a credit amt 0-1ml
 >> the loans for good price falls between 0-1ml
 >> the loans with the annuity of 0-50k




Banks should target business entity type 3, self-employed people.

Most of the cancelled or refused prev application , 80-90% of them are repayers in the current data. So previously refused or cancelled applications are safe to go with.



Precautionss-

-people are mostly unacompannied
-Lower secondary
-Unmarried people
-Rented apartment has been the highest defaulter percentage
-Low skill labourers, drivers are the highest defaulters.
-Transport type 3 is the highest defaulter
-Offers which were unused prev now have maximum number of defaulters despite the high income band customers
